# 250702-attiny85-ps2-reset-perixx-kbd-mod-zeal8bit
journey to fix missing init+config of ps2(usb?) keyboard based on holtek mcu by using digispark attiny85

it started yesterday on zeal8bit discord, then one guy posted this link and I started to think about raw attiny1624 soic14 I have here, but then cosidered arduino nano every with exposed microusb and ended up with even simpler digispatk attiny85 I have here also in larger batch for some "surprise cases..." ))
